# Machine Learning Journey
This repository contains:
1. My notes on the book "Mathematics for Machine Learning" (PDF and [HTML](https://pranav-joshi-iitgn.github.io/ML_Journey/))
2. Many different machine learning models, either built from scratch, using only `numpy`, or using models from `sklearn`
3. An automatic differentiation system (`MLlib.py) to create trainable neural networks.
4. Usage of the Automatic differentiation system for different tasks, like
   1. Digit Classification (`Digits.ipynb`)
   2. Iris dataset classification (`Iris.ipynb`)
   3. Embedding (`Embed.ipynb`)
   4. Reccurent Neural Network (`RNN.ipynb`)
   5. Illustration of Automotic differentiation (`AutoDiff.ipynb`)
6. Data Narratives on a few datasets
