# ML_Journey
This repository contains:
1. My notes on the book "Mathematics for Machine Learning" (PDF and HTML)
2. Many different machine learning models, mostly built from scratch, using `numpy`
3. An automatic differentiation system (`Autodiff.ipynb`) to create trainable neural networks.
4. Usage of the Automatic differentiation system for different tasks, like
   1. Digit Classification (`Digits.ipynb`)
   2. Iris dataset classification (`Iris.ipynb`)
6. Data Narratives on a few databases
